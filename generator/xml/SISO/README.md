## SISO-REF-010-2020: Reference for Enumerations for Simulation Interoperability

From SISO website:
SISO-REF-010 specifies numerical values and associated definitions for fields that are identified as enumerations in SISO Standards Products and SISO-sponsored standards published by IEEE for High Level Architecture (HLA) and Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS). Enumerations for simulations may be applied in other architectures, such as the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA). SISO Product Data Files associated with this product are included in the above link, but just the PDF is available separately for the enumerations and OPMAN.
